# UNICEF Assessment Strategy Guide

## Assessment Criteria & How to Meet Them

### 1. ✅ Workflow and Code Structure

**Demonstrated Through:**
- **Organized Directory Structure**: Clear separation of raw data, processed data, scripts, and outputs
- **Sequential Script Naming**: Numbered scripts (01_, 02_, etc.) for logical workflow
- **Master Script**: `main.R` orchestrates entire workflow
- **Modular Design**: Each script has a single responsibility
- **Clear Documentation**: README explains project structure and workflow

**Best Practices Implemented:**
- Consistent naming conventions
- Logical file organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Error handling in master script

### 2. ✅ Collaborative Work Environment Proficiency

**Demonstrated Through:**
- **Version Control**: Git repository with meaningful commit messages
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and inline code comments
- **Reproducible Setup**: Requirements file and installation instructions
- **Professional Structure**: Industry-standard project layout
- **Clear Communication**: Well-documented code and processes

**Collaborative Features:**
- Easy onboarding for new team members
- Clear contribution guidelines (implicit in structure)
- Standardized workflow that others can follow
- Professional commit history

### 3. ✅ Reproducible Research Practices

**Demonstrated Through:**
- **Complete Workflow**: From raw data to final output
- **Dependency Management**: Requirements file with version specifications
- **Data Pipeline**: Clear data transformation steps
- **Version Control**: All code and data tracked
- **Documentation**: Every step documented and explained

**Reproducibility Features:**
- One-command execution (`main.R`)
- Clear data lineage
- Automated error handling
- Consistent output structure

## Next Steps for Assessment

1. **Complete the Analysis Pipeline**
   - Finish remaining R scripts (04-06)
   - Ensure all scripts work together seamlessly
   - Test the complete workflow

2. **Generate Outputs**
   - Create visualizations and reports
   - Document key findings
   - Ensure outputs are professional and insightful

3. **Final Review**
   - Test reproducibility on clean environment
   - Review all documentation
   - Ensure professional presentation

4. **GitHub Deployment**
   - Push to GitHub with professional commit history
   - Ensure repository is well-organized and accessible
   - Verify all links and documentation work correctly
